<h3>FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL</h3>
<p>
	<h1>Letter of Intent</h1>
	I'm a big fan of music discovery, and I love new apps and methods that let me find new music in creative ways. For my final project, I want to make a page that will in some way contribute to the ecosystem of indie music discovery that I spend so much time enjoying online. 
</p>

<h2>Theme/Subject</h2>
<p> I'll try to avoid making it into a personal portfolio, but I still want it to have some relevance to me and my social group. It'll be a curator-driven website, not user-driven, but there will still be able to be input from the larger audience. </p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The project will include images, links, live audio, and jQuery implementation using Spotify's API to generate content and interactive music elements on the site.</p>
