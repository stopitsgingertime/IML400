<h3>FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL</h3>

	<h1>Letter of Intent</h1><p>
	I'm a big fan of music discovery, and I love new apps and methods that let me find new music in creative ways. For my final project, I want to make a page that will in some way contribute to the ecosystem of indie music discovery that I spend so much time enjoying online. 
</p>

<h2>Theme/Subject</h2>
<p> I'll try to avoid making it into a personal portfolio, but I still want it to have some relevance to me and my social group. It'll be a curator-driven website, not user-driven, but there will still be able to be input from the larger audience. </p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The project will include images, links, live audio, and jQuery implementation using Spotify's API to generate content and interactive music elements on the site.</p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>

<P>The elements of my site will be dynamic and simplified, to aid in ease of use and guide discovery. Artist photos will display alongside curatorial blurbs written by me (or whoever is running the site), and simple "MORE!" and "NAH" buttons will allow the user to guide their exploration, jumping between algorithmic related-artist searching or merely following the curatorial suggestions of the site's writers.</p>
