<h3>response three</h3>
<p>These readings tell the complicated story about how virtual reality, as a technology, has tripped and stumbled its way to relevance through the second half of the 20th century into the 21st. The innovators of the 50s and 60s foresaw the potential for the technology, but the actual machinery of the 90s couldn’t match up to the era’s fervent fictional imagination of what it all could be, and so the industry folded in on itself only to reemerge when the time was right (eg: now). 

</p>

<p>
The similarities between the 90s view of VR worlds and today’s understanding of the open web makes for a confluence of attitudes between supporters of the open web and developers of VR technologies, a generally very liberal demographic that looks towards technology as an opportunity for exploration and democratic creation. Josh Carpenter at Mozilla emphasizes the potential for userbase creation of VR content in his interview, and hopefully VR does move towards that goal and not simply stick to the corporate-owned, gated app-store model that a lot of new technologies are based on these days.

People not really aware of the details of VR tend to think of it as being based around games as its medium, so it’s interesting to read about the ways in which VR could support other media like augmented reality, television and film, and the general infrastructure of the web. Interactivity is a big part of it, obviously, but that doesn’t have to be the whole part of it. If VR really takes off then I hope there will be a large proportion of its engineering guided by the masses and not by tech overlords.
