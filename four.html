<h3>response session 8</h3>
<p>This article on net art, (or as it calls it “net.art”) is only seven years old, but even today seems slightly antiquated and outmoded in its assessment of internet-native forms of artistic expression (although that might just be by dint of the fact that it’s in the Wall Street Journal). The article’s positioning of internet-based art as a completely separate sphere unto itself is at odds with my own prior perception of net art as merely an extension and additional medium that most of today’s contemporary artists experience at least a portion of their practice in.

I attended the New Museum’s excellent 2014 Triennial exhibit, curated by Ryan Trecartin and featuring works by artists commonly characterized as exemplifying the net art genre, such as Juliana Huxtable, Casey Jane Ellison, and Trecartin himself, but I didn’t feel as though any of those artists were bound by the strictures of the internet. Their art was enhanced and informed by their online experiences, and many of the works were created for or in the internet prior to their IRL showing, but none of them strictly belong in a “net art” category.

At this juncture in contemporary art culture, I think that any art that attempts to engage with modern society WITHOUT interacting or approaching the internet in some way falls short of having the potential to truly connect and reflect our world, which is one of the main goals of art. So, that is to say, all art in some way should be of the “net.”
