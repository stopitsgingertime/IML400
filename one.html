<h3>response one</h3>
<p>This article about the mechanisms of complexity and organization on the internet from 1997 is fascinating to read and look back on 19 years later, from a variety of different standpoints. It’s interesting that originally, before the infrastructure was capable of actually being a delivery system for media, it was seen as merely the equivalent of a catalog or index that pointed to media outside of itself. Ito declares that the internet’s content “is information about information about information,” which some parts of today’s contemporary internet certainly still are. But the existence of the entire network as a context-oriented system has been hugely supplanted by Web 2.0/the social web’s content-oriented system, causing a huge shift from the original ways in which people used the web.

It’s also fascinating that Ito specifically touches on the absence of instantaneity in the Web of 1997— “Yesterday's newspapers are free on the Internet, but today's (or tomorrow's) can cost you money.” The lack of temporal relevance that characterized the context-oriented early Web has been completely turned on its head in the 19 years since this article; the Web being now, of course, literally the most instantaneous delivery system possible. Now, instead of having to pay for the new but access the old for free, you can read articles online the second they’re posted but must pay a subscription fee to access the archives. The priorities of the web have shifted towards now-ness.

The author’s argument that the introduction of rigid protocols to a system like the internet has the potential to cause weakness is an interesting one, especially since now that we’ve passed out of the wild days of the unfettered Internet 1.0 into the social web, where most traffic passes through a handful of dedicated platforms. Ito’s prediction of a shock to that slimmed-down system causing a collapse could be a prescient one— if something happened to Amazon Web Services or Google or Facebook, the less-distributed internet would be massively damaged.
