<h3>response two</h3>
<p>It’s interesting to read the introduction to the piece before reading the actual piece, because it provides a context for the different Internet protocols competing for the world’s attention before CERN’s W3 came to prominence. It shows that the triumph of the web came in its hypertextual simplicity, without the attempts at media diversity that other platforms were trying in the wild west of the early internet. 

</p>

<p>
The CERN paper details the innovations that made W3 such a powerful yet simple protocol, and one that has had an immeasurable impact on the contemporary world and culture. The flexibility of W3 cannnot be understated— the paper describes how many different clients can all access the same hypertext locations, and also how HTTP’s stateless nature allows infinite file formats to be shared privately and publicly between users. Unlike the proprietary, for-profit nature of competing Internet navigational formats at the time, W3 was open and ever-evolving, which allowed the basic structural backbone of the architecture to grow to suppor the intense peaks of the information age that we are currently experiencing.

<p>
W3 started out as a way to share information, which the introduction contrasts with the other formats attempting to start out sharing other types of media. The simplicity of Berners-Lee’s proposal was its biggest strength, spreading the client-server load across the entire network to allow for ease of communication. This innovation still today forms the basis of our web, and it’s incredible to see how the multi-faceted internet we know today grew out of such a simple hypertext proposal.
